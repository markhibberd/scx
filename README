NAME
        scx - a scala compilation utility with support for cross compilation

DESCRIPTION
        scx provides an interface that wraps scalac and javac to facilitate
	simple compilation, including compilation of joint scala and java
	projects.

USAGE
        Compile scala only:
            scx -cp lib src classes

        Compile scala and java:
            scx -j -cp lib src classes
 
STATE
        The `scx` executable is under development, but command line options
	shall be backward compatible in future releases.

LIMITATIONS
        scx has no direct support for cross compilation between scala versions,
	this is planned for version 1.0.
